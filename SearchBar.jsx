/*

SearchBar should be a form input field, with a placeholder text

This component will need useState hook: initial value of movie title as an empty string
    Once user begins typing, the value will change to the e.target.value
        On tap/click/enter of keyboard event, the value will return to an empty string

The data entered into SearchBar will be passed up to the parent component, which will handle this
